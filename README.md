# AOC2023
This is the official Adabtive Advent of Code 2023 Repo

This year Adabtive is competing in Advent of Code. Advent of Code is an annual event in December from the 1st - 24th. Each day a puzzle/project is uploaded at 6:00 AM Amsterdam Time. The puzzles/projects usually build upon each other, and gain in complexity as the month goes on. You also must submit your correct solution before the next day’s challenge is released or you are eliminated from the official challenge. 



Adabtive will participate in a quasi-competitive format. We do not feel comfortable requesting people code during the weekend/off times, so we have a slightly updated format. 

For anyone participating you are given “breathing room”, this means you must be caught up by Wednesday morning of every week, excluding Wednesday's puzzle. (Please keep in mind the official Advent of Code will not have breathing room.) 

Here is how we will “play”:

We will meet daily (workdays) around 10:30 to discuss the puzzle of the day, and the solution from the day before. 

On Wednesday we check if the teams have completed all the previous days' exercises.

We will upload our official submissions to our GitHub (here.) 

Tentative We will allot 1 extra hour of work daily for those still in the competition from the 1st - 12th, and from the 13th - the 24th we will allot 2 hours a day as extra hours. This means the longer you participate the more hours you accrue (maximum 36 hours per person.) 

We are teammates first and competitors second, collaborating is encouraged. 

You will only participate in the advent of code while you have the bandwidth, when/if it is too much you are encouraged to stop, this should be fun, not exhausting. 

Tentative Winner(s): Receive 100 Euros, we will start in teams, but if one teammate drops out the remaining participant can continue on to victory. The last one standing wins, you do not need to complete the Advent of Code to win.
